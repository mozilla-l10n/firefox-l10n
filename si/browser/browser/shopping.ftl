## Strings for the unanalyzed product card.
## The word 'analyzer' when used here reflects what this tool is called on

## tool (the Fakespot by Mozilla 'analyzer') other than 'checker', which is
## used in the name of the Firefox feature ('Review Checker'). If that is not
## possible - if these terms are not meaningfully different - that is OK.
