# Firefox Localizations

This repository contains the localized messages for all Firefox locales.

If you’d like to submit translations or suggest improvements to existing
strings please visit us on [Pontoon](https://pontoon.mozilla.org/projects/firefox/).
Changes to translations will not be accepted by pull request
with exceptions for specific locales:
- `it`: Translations committed to repo directly by @flodolo as part of source string localizability review process.
- `ja` and  `ja-JP-mac`: Translations are merged via PR due to legacy constraints.

## String updates

This repo contains only localized files;
source strings are located in the
[firefox-l10n-source](https://github.com/mozilla-l10n/firefox-l10n-source/)
repository.

Newly translated strings are committed to the `main` branch
via Pontoon’s [translation sync](https://github.com/mozilla/pontoon/blob/main/pontoon/sync/README.md).
