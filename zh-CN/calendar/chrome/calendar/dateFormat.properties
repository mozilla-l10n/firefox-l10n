# In case you are looking for the note about different declensions on date
# formats, here it is. If your language doesn't use different declensions of
# month names, you shouldn't have much work. Just leave the *.monthFormat
# string on "nominative" and the string month.*.name will be filled in.
#
# If you need a different form for a string, you can change the 
# *.monthFormat to a different value. Supported values are currently:
#    nominative (default), genitive
# The modified month name form will then be filled in accordingly. If this
# system does not suit your needs, please file a bug!

# LOCALIZATION NOTE (month.*.name):
# Some languages require different declensions of month names.
# These values will be used if *.monthFormat is set to "nominative" or in places
# where using a different declension is not yet supported.

# LOCALIZATION NOTE (month.*.genitive):
# Some languages require different declensions of month names.
# These values will be used if *.monthFormat is set to "genitive"
# If your language doesn't use different declensions, just set the same
# values as for month.*.name.
