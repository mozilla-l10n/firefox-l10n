<!-- LOCALIZATION NOTE (happy.message): "share the love" — This feels purposely exaggerated in English,
     but essentially it means that we want you to let others know how much you love Firefox. -->
<!ENTITY happy.message             "想在 Goolge Play 上给我们以五星评价以分享你的喜爱？">

<!-- LOCALIZATION NOTE (sad.thanksMessageBottom): We're suggesting that there will be consequences for the people working
     on Firefox if they don't resolve the user's problem, like "or if they don't fix it, we'll fire them." If this doesn't
     work in your language, you can change it to something like "no matter what" or just remove it entirely. -->
<!ENTITY sad.thanksMessageBottom   "或者其他。">

<!-- LOCALIZATION NOTE (idea.message): In English, "please share your thoughts" could mean that we're asking the user to
     tell us any thoughts or ideas they have about anything, so we're jokingly telling them not to use the space below
     to tell us anything they're thinking about. -->

<!-- LOCALIZATION NOTE (idea.thanksMessageBottom): "high five" — This is a celebratory or congratulatory gesture.
     It could also be a handshake, a pat on the back, a thumbs up or something similar. The idea is that it's
     something physical, which is why they can't see it.-->
<!ENTITY idea.thanksMessageBottom  "你看不见它，但我们现在就会为你欢呼。">
