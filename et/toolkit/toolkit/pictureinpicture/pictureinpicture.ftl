pictureinpicture-player-title = Pilt-pildis

## Variables:
##   $shortcut (String) - Keyboard shortcut to execute the command.

## Note that this uses .tooltip rather than the standard '.title'

## picture-in-picture window will read and copy this to an in-document
## DOM node that then shows the tooltip.
