# Encoding warnings and errors
EncNoDeclarationFrame = The character encoding of a framed document was not declared. The document may appear different if viewed without the document framing it.
EncMetaUnsupported = An unsupported character encoding was declared for the HTML document using a meta tag. The declaration was ignored.
EncProtocolUnsupported = An unsupported character encoding was declared on the transfer protocol level. The declaration was ignored.
EncMetaUtf16 = A meta tag was used to declare the character encoding as UTF-16. This was interpreted as an UTF-8 declaration instead.
