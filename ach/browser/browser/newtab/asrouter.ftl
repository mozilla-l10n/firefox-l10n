## MR2022 Background Update Windows native toast notification strings.
##
## These strings will be displayed by the Windows operating system in
## a native toast, like:
##
## <b>multi-line title</b>
## multi-line text
## <img>
## [ primary button ] [ secondary button ]
##
## The button labels are fitted into narrow fixed-width buttons by
## Windows and therefore must be as narrow as possible.

# This button label will be fitted into a narrow fixed-width button by
# Windows. Try to not exceed the width of the English text (compare it
# using a variable font like Arial): the button can only fit 1-2
# additional characters, exceeding characters will be truncated.
