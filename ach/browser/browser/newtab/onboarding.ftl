## Firefox 100 Thank You screens

# "Hero Text" displayed on left side of welcome screen. This text can be
# formatted to span multiple lines as needed. The <span data-l10n-name="zap">
# </span> in this string allows a "zap" underline style to be automatically
# added to the text inside it. "Yous" should stay inside the zap span, but
# "Thank" can be put inside instead if there's no "you" in the translation.
# The English text would normally be "100 Thank-Yous" i.e., plural noun, but for
# aesthetics of splitting it across multiple lines, the hyphen is omitted.
