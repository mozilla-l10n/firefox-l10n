    but, in short, to manually test that your instrumentation works, you should:

about-glean-no-ping-label = (don’t submit any ping)
# An in-line text input field precedes this string.
about-glean-label-for-tag-pings = In the preceding field ensure there is a memorable debug tag so you can recognise your pings later.

    Select from the preceding list the ping your instrumentation is in.
    If it’s in a <a data-l10n-name="custom-ping-link">custom ping</a>, choose that one.
    Otherwise, the default for <code>event</code> metrics is

about-glean-label-for-log-pings =

about-glean-label-for-controls-submit =
    Press the preceding button to tag all { -glean-brand-name } pings with your tag and submit the selected ping.

about-glean-adhoc-explanation =
    For more <i>ad hoc</i> testing,
    you can also determine the current value of a particular piece of instrumentation
    by opening a devtools console here on <code>about:glean</code>

about-glean-adhoc-explanation2 =
    For more <i>ad hoc</i> testing,
    you can also determine the current value of a particular piece of instrumentation

    for a metric named <code>metric.category.metric_name</code>.
# Do not translate strings between <code> </code> tags.
about-glean-adhoc-note =
    Please note that you are using the Glean JS API by using the devtools console.
    This means the metric category and metric name are formatted in
    <code>camelCase</code> unlike in the Rust and C++ APIs.
about-glean-profiler-explanation =
    To see a full view of all recorded metrics, you can use the { -profiler-brand-name }.

    In the performance profile you can see all the metrics collected, when they were

    you can verify that the correct value was collected and that collection happened at the right time.
