<!-- LOCALIZATION NOTE (happy.message): "share the love" — This feels purposely exaggerated in English,
     but essentially it means that we want you to let others know how much you love Firefox. -->
<!-- LOCALIZATION NOTE (happy.finePrint): "feels great" — Another exaggeration where we're trying to
     get people to rate us by playfully telling them there's a benefit in it for them as well. -->






<!-- LOCALIZATION NOTE (sad.urlPlaceholder): Placeholder text that appears in "Last visited site" input box when there is no text. -->

<!ENTITY sad.urlPlaceholder        "http://">
<!ENTITY sad.thanksHeader          "Takk fyrir að láta okkur vita.">
<!-- LOCALIZATION NOTE (sad.thanksMessageTop): "real people" — We're stating that an actual human will look at the feedback
     and that it doesn't just go to some automated system that looks for keywords, or something like that. -->
<!-- LOCALIZATION NOTE (sad.thanksMessageBottom): We're suggesting that there will be consequences for the people working
     on Firefox if they don't resolve the user's problem, like "or if they don't fix it, we'll fire them." If this doesn't
     work in your language, you can change it to something like "no matter what" or just remove it entirely. -->
