# Displayed in the Synced Tabs sidebar's context menu when right-clicking tabs
# and/or devices in the list. This string is for a menuitem equivalent to one in
# the tab context menu (activated by right-clicking a tab in the tabstrip). That
# string is located in tabContextMenu.ftl. So, this string should be translated
# consistently with the "Bookmark Tab…" string there.
