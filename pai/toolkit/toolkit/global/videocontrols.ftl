# This message shows the current position and total video duration
#
# Variables:
#   $position (String): The current media position
#   $duration (String): The total video duration
#
# For example, when at the 5 minute mark in a 6 hour long video,
# $position would be "5:00" and $duration would be "6:00:00", result
# string would be "5:00 / 6:00:00". Note that $duration is not always
# available. For example, when at the 5 minute mark in an unknown
# duration video, $position would be "5:00" and the string which is
# surrounded by <span> would be deleted, result string would be "5:00".
