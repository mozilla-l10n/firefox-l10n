### UI strings for the simplified onboarding modal / about:welcome
### Various strings use a non-breaking space to avoid a single dangling /
### widowed word, so test on various window sizes if you also want this.


## These button action text can be split onto multiple lines, so use explicit
## newlines in translations to control where the line break appears (e.g., to
## avoid breaking quoted text).

onboarding-button-label-learn-more = Tuilleadh Eolais
onboarding-button-label-try-now = Bain Triail As Anois
onboarding-button-label-get-started = Tús Maith

## Welcome modal dialog strings

onboarding-welcome-header = Fáilte go { -brand-short-name }

## These are individual benefit messages shown with an image, title and
## description.

onboarding-benefit-products-title = Táirgí Úsáideacha
onboarding-benefit-privacy-title = Fíorphríobháideachas

## These strings belong to the individual onboarding messages.


## Each message has a title and a description of what the browser feature is.
## Each message also has an associated button for the user to try the feature.
## The string for the button is found above, in the UI strings section
