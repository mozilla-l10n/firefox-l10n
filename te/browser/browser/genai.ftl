## Generative AI (GenAI) Settings section


## Chatbot prompts
## Prompts are plain language ‘instructions’ sent to a chatbot.
## These prompts have been made concise and direct in English because some chatbot providers
## have character restrictions and being direct reduces the chance for misinterpretation.
## When localizing, please be concise and direct, but not at the expense of losing meaning.
