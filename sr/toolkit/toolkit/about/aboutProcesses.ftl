## Displaying CPU (percentage and total)
## Variables:
##    $percent (Number) The percentage of CPU used by the process or thread.

##    $delta (Number) The absolute value of the amount of memory added recently.
##    $deltaSign (String) Either "+" if the amount of memory has increased
##                        or "-" if it has decreased.
##    $deltaUnit (String) The unit in which to display $delta. See the definitions
