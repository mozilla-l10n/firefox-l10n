## The Enterprise Policies feature is aimed at system administrators
## who want to deploy these settings across several Firefox installations
## all at once. This is traditionally done through the Windows Group Policy
## feature, but the system also supports other forms of deployment.
## These are short descriptions for individual policies, to be displayed
## in the documentation section in about:policies.
