<!-- LOCALIZATION NOTE (crashprompt.detailedMessage.thirdParagraph, crashprompt.privacyPolicyLink):
     These two entities form a single sentence. crashprompt.privacyPolicyLink is a
     clickable link that must follow crashprompt.detailedMessage.thirdParagraph.
     If the structure of the English strings doesn't work for your locale, you can
     move "&brandShortName; privacy policy." to the first sentence, and use a
     generic "More information" for the link. These strings will be updated in the
     next version of Firefox. -->
